Tools to help make money on Hypixel Skyblock.

BAZAAR FLIPPER
Bazaar analyzer uses Hypixel API to get the data on all the items on the bazaar.
Analyzing them includes calculating margins and trade volume to determine if
it's worth buying.

AUCTION FLIPPER
AH sniper uses the same API to get the items from the Auction House.
It goes through all the items and filters the names and other important information,
such as rarity upgrades. It then checks other similar items to find the lowest price,
and to see if any of them have a significantly lower price, meaning it can be flipped
for profit.
